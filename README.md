# Understanding Typescript

This repository is where I am working through the [Understanding Typescript](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript) by Maximilian Schwarzmüller on Udemny.

Each section is completed in a branch and each exercise's final state is tagged. Once a section is complete its branch is merged back to main so the final state is availible in folder with the same name as the section:
* [Section 10 - Modules & Namespaces](Section%2010%20-%20Modules%20&%20Namespaces) on branch: [10-modules-and-namespaces](https://github.com/jonsmorrow/UNDERSTANDING-TS/tree/10-modules-and-namespaces)
