# Understanding Typescript

This repository is where I am working through the [Understanding Typescript](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemny.

Each section is completed in a branch and each exercise's final state is tagged. Once a section is complete its branch is merged back to main so the final state is availible in folder with the same name as the section:
* [Section 8 - Decorators](Section%208%20-%20Decorators) on branch: [08-decorators](https://github.com/jonsmorrow/UNDERSTANDING-TS/tree/08-decorators)
