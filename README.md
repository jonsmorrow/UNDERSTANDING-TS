# Understanding Typescript

This repository is where I am working through the [Understanding Typescript](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemny.

Each section is completed in a branch and each exercise's final state is tagged. Once a section is complete its branch is merged back to main so the final state is availible in folder with the same name as the section:
* [Section 13 - Time to Practice Let's build a "Select & Share a Place" App](Section%2013%20-%20Time%20to%20Practice%20Let%27s%20build%20a%20%22Select%20%26%20Share%20a%20Place%22%20App) on branch: [13-project-02-share-a-place](https://github.com/jonsmorrow/UNDERSTANDING-TS/tree/13-project-02-share-a-place)
